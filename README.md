# Concrete5 Burrito

This is a group of libraries, classes, and other tools that greatly increase the speed at which we can create custom elements for Concrete5 projects. It also changes the Dashboard background to a subtle dark texture rather than the daily feed of images. 

## Installation

Download or clone this repo to your Concrete5 site's *packages/* directory. Then, visit **yoursite.com/index.php/dashboard/extend/install/** and install the package. Once the package is installed, you can begin consuming the Burrito.

## Documentation / Usage

Someone needs to write this :)
